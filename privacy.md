## How we process your data

This website is powered by Jekyll and is hosted on **Netlify**.

**Netlify** (like any hosting company) can have full insight in visitor data, like connecting IP addresses, visited pages, etc.
More information about that in [their privacy statement][netlify-privacy]. 

By using a VPN you can (try to) prevent this.
